Collection of scripts to run POLARIS on FIRE simulations for calculating synchrotron emission

1. mock_example/: example code to make a grid with constant B field and CR density for testing purposes
        use make_mock_yt_cube.py to read in a simulation snapshot and modify its contents to have the desired values of B, ncr etc
	use converter_octree_fakecubeyt.py to make the octree
        note: octree converter script slightly different than that in process_sims since we don't need to recompute n_cr

2. process_sims/: scripts to preprocess simulation snapshots and run polaris
		convert_FIRE_cubes_Suoqing_newyt.py: holds functions to read Gizmo output and write to grid format
						           user can select to zoom within a specified radius and the resulting number of pixels
		cube_gen.py: creates a gridded cube (hdf5) using the functions in convert_FIRE_cubes_Suoqing_newyt.py
        cube_gen.sbatch: batch script to run on wheeler - sends email when done (change email address in script for this)
        converter_octree_snapshot.py: converts hdf5 grid file to octree format for input to Polaris        
        run_polaris.py: python wrapper that creates command file for Polaris and runs Polaris
        plot_data.py: example script to plot fits file outputs of polaris

Run scripts in this order:

1) python3.7 cube_gen.py (or the corresponding batch script) to make a gridded cube
2) python3.7 converter_octree_snapshot.py to convert that cube to octree
3) python3.7 run_polaris.py to run Polaris 
Then you may copy the output fits files (usually in results/.../data/) to local pc
and plot output with plot_data.py
